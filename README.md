# CYO-Project
HarvardX Data Science Certificate: Choose Your Own Project

This is the second project from the capstone course on Edx.org.
I chose credit card fraud detection with a synthetic dataset from Kaggle.

Project Instructions:
Use a publicly available dataset to solve the problem of your choice and apply machine learning techniques that go beyond standard linear regression.
You will submit a report that documents your analysis and presents your findings, with supporting statistics and figures.
